# Day 2 – Interview Questions: Load Balancer

## 1. Why can’t clients directly call service instances?

Clients cannot directly call service instances because they have no awareness of instance availability, health, or load.
Without an intermediary, requests may hit failed or overloaded instances, leading to instability and poor user experience.

---

## 2. What problems does a load balancer solve?

A load balancer solves:
- Instance discovery
- Health-based routing
- Load distribution
- Failure isolation

It provides a stable entry point and improves system availability and reliability.

---

## 3. What happens if a load balancer does not perform health checks?

Without health checks, a load balancer may continue routing traffic to unhealthy or failed instances, causing increased errors and degraded user experience.
This defeats the primary purpose of using a load balancer for high availability.

---

## 4. Is a load balancer mainly used for scaling?

No.  
A load balancer is primarily used for **failure handling and reliability**.
Scalability is a secondary benefit that becomes effective when combined with stateless services.

---

## 5. How do load balancers and stateless services work together?

Stateless services allow any instance to handle any request.
This enables the load balancer to freely route traffic to healthy instances, ensuring seamless failover and horizontal scalability.

---

## 6. What is the difference between auto-scaling and load balancing?

- Auto-scaling manages **capacity** by adding or removing instances
- Load balancing manages **traffic routing** and **failure handling**

Both are required for a resilient system.
